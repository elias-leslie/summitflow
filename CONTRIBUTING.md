# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to look at SummitFlow.

This repository is published primarily as a working public codebase, not as a
high-volume community project. Contributions are welcome, but review and merge
decisions are handled on a best-effort basis.

## Before You Start

- Open an issue before larger changes so direction stays aligned.
- Keep pull requests small, focused, and easy to review.
- Preserve existing architecture and coding patterns unless the change is
  intentionally restructuring them.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes.

## Development

Project setup and service commands are documented in [README.md](README.md).

Backend checks:

```bash
cd backend
uv sync --all-extras --dev
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest
uv build
```

Frontend checks:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --filter summitflow-frontend lint
pnpm --filter summitflow-frontend exec tsc --noEmit
