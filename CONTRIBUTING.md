# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to look at SummitFlow.

This repository is published primarily as a working public codebase, not as a
high-volume community project. Contributions are welcome, but review and merge
decisions are handled on a best-effort basis.

## Before You Start

- Open an issue before larger changes so direction stays aligned.
- Keep pull requests small, focused, and easy to review.
- Preserve existing architecture and coding patterns unless the change is
  intentionally restructuring them.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes.

## Development

Project setup and service commands are documented in [README.md](README.md).

Quality checks should use the project wrappers:

```bash
dt --check --changed-only
```

Use the repo service scripts when you need to verify runtime behavior:

```bash
bash scripts/restart.sh
bash scripts/rebuild.sh
```

## Licensing

By submitting a contribution, you represent that you have the right to license
